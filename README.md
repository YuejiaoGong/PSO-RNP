Since many people sent me emails to request our code for the following paper:

Yue-Jiao Gong, Meie Shen, Jun Zhang, et al., “Optimizing RFID network planning by using a particle swarm optimization algorithm with redundant reader elimination,” IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, vol. 8, no. 4, pp. 900-912, 2012.

I decided to put it online. The code was written a couple of years ago by the C language. Sorry for the lack of program comments to improve the readability. 

For use of the codes, please do not forget to cite the above reference. Thank you for the interest of our work. 

Good luck!
